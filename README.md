# Cloud Engineering Portfolio

## Overview

A collection of production-style cloud infrastructure and automation projects — covering Linux, Python, AWS, Terraform, Docker, and CI/CD. Each project below is a standalone, deployed, and documented system, built as part of an ongoing self-directed specialization in cloud infrastructure engineering.

## Featured Projects

### [ECS Weather Platform – Security Hardening](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/ecs-weather-platform-secured)
The security-hardened evolution of a full production-style AWS platform — containerized on ECS with complete CI/CD and CloudWatch monitoring, further secured with customer-managed KMS keys, IAM least-privilege policies, Secrets Manager, Parameter Store, CloudTrail auditing, and automated secret scanning (TruffleHog). Every hardening change was verified to preserve full application availability and database connectivity.

**Tech Stack:** Terraform, AWS KMS, IAM, Secrets Manager, Systems Manager, CloudTrail, ECS, Docker, GitHub Actions, CloudWatch

*Built in stages — see the full progression: [initial platform](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/ecs-weather-platform) → [CI/CD added](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/ecs-weather-platform-cicd) → [monitoring added](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/ecs-weather-platform-with-monitoring) → security hardening (this repo).*

### [Terraform Three-Tier AWS Infrastructure](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/terraform-three-tier)
Modularized, fully reproducible three-tier AWS architecture (network, compute, data layers) deployed via Terraform, with remote state management.    

**Tech Stack:** Terraform, AWS VPC/EC2/RDS, S3 backend, DynamoDB state locking

---

### [EC2-RDS Application](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/EC2-RDS-App)
Application deployment extending a load-balanced, auto-scaling EC2 environment with a managed RDS database backend, using security group isolation between the application and data tiers.   

**Tech Stack:** AWS EC2, RDS, security groups, networking

---

### [ALB / ASG Deployer](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/ALB-ASG-déployer)
Highly available, auto-scaling EC2 environment behind an Application Load Balancer, scaling automatically based on CPU load.


**Tech Stack:** AWS ALB, Auto Scaling Groups, EC2, CloudWatch

---

### [Backup Automation System](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/backup-automation)
Production-grade backup tool with compression, SHA-256 checksum validation, intelligent rotation, and S3 upload integration.


**Tech Stack:** Python, subprocess, tar/gzip, checksums, CLI development

---

### [Weather API Fetcher](https://github.com/Aboubakr2000Cloud/weather-api-fetcher)
Python automation tool with intelligent retry logic, API authentication, and production-ready error handling.   

**Tech Stack:** Python, requests, logging, argparse, environment variables
